Certainly! Here's a section for your README.md where you can list future improvements or areas for enhancement:

## To-Do / Future Improvements

While the current version of the project fulfills the basic requirements, there are several areas that could be enhanced or extended if more time and resources were available. Consider the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced UI:**
   - Implement a touch-friendly user interface to match modern file explorers.
   - Introduce dark mode for improved user experience in low-light environments.

2. **Migration to TypeScript:**
   - Convert the codebase to TypeScript for improved static typing, better code quality, and enhanced development tooling.

3. **Testing Coverage:**
   - Expand the test suite to cover more components, features, and edge cases.
   - Integrate additional testing libraries or tools for comprehensive test coverage.

4. **Tabbed File Explorer:**
   - Introduce a tabbed interface to the file explorer, allowing users to quickly switch between opened files.
   - Enhance user productivity by providing a seamless multi-file editing experience.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Identify and implement performance optimizations to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, especially when dealing with a large number of files.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
